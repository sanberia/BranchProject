# BranchProject
This project uses Node.js, Axios, and Express to return a json object when given a username.
I went with Node.js due to simplicity and ease of use.

Run with "node index" and use port 5000.
'/' prints Hello World !!! as a test and any '/<username>' should print the json data formatted as requested
 Unit tests use Jest and can be run with npm test.
