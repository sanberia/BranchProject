# BranchProject
This project uses Node.js, Axios, and Express to return a json object when given a username.
I went with Node.js due to simplicity and ease of use.

Copy and paste just the authorization token into a file called token.txt in the same directory as index.js
Run with "node index" and use port 5000.

'/' prints Hello World !!! as a test and any '/username' should print the json data retrieved from github and formatted as requested
 
 Unit tests use Jest and can be run with npm test.
